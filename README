AnnotateSchema
==============

Add a comment summarizing the current schema to the top
of each ActiveRecord model source file:

  # Schema as of Sun Feb 26 21:58:32 CST 2006 (schema version 7)
  #
  #  id                  :integer(11)   not null
  #  quantity            :integer(11)   
  #  product_id          :integer(11)   
  #  unit_price          :float         
  #  order_id            :integer(11)   
  #

  class LineItem < ActiveRecord::Base belongs_to :product
  
   . . .
  
This code will try to insert the schema comment block just before the first "class" line it finds, 
so that your own model comments will remain at the top. This version uses an "End Schema" to 
help in updating only the schema section of the comment without blowing everything else away.

This version will also look for fixtures under both the test and spec directories.

This version will also scan into subdirectories of the app/models directory in case you've 
named-spaced your models.
